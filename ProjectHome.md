This is a Goal-Oriented Requirements Editor for Web Applications created using Graphical Modeling Framework. The editor adapts the goal-oriented modeling framework for requirements analysis i`*` (iStar) to the Web domain.

With this editor the designer can creates a requirements specification model in the Web domain. The model conforms to the i`*` metamodel, with this metamodel, the i`*` framework was adapted to be used in the Web field. Therefore, a transformation M2M (model-2-model) can be apply to the requirements model in order to obtain the conceptual models for the Web application or directly the code using M2T (model-to-text) transformations.

The type of requirements that the designer can use to represent the requirements for a Web application are: Content, Navigational, Personalization, Service, Layout and Softgoals (Non-functional requirements). Also, the designer can use the common i`*` elements as Goals, tasks, resources, actors, etc.
