The development of a data warehouse claims for an in-depth analysis
of data sources. In the previous chapter, it is assumed that a
documentation of the data sources is available. However, this is not
always true, since in real scenarios data sources are truly legacy
systems and its manual analysis may become highly difficult. To
overcome these problems, in this chapter the development of a data
warehouse  is considered as a modernization scenario that addresses
the analysis of the available data sources, thus discovering
multidimensional structures to either derive a data-driven
conceptual multidimensional model or reconcile a requirement-driven
conceptual multidimensional model with data sources. The content of
this chapter corresponds with the part of the approach shaded in the
figure below.

The content of this chapter was published in the \emph{International
Conference on Conceptual Modeling (ER)}. It is one of the  most
important conferences in data and process modeling, database
technology, and database applications. This conference is a wide
forum for researchers and industrial experts interested in all
aspects of database and information systems design and usage. Topics
of interest include data warehousing and business intelligence.
\emph{ER} is a top-ranking conference, since it has an
\emph{Estimated Impact of Conference (EIC)} value of \emph{0.91}
according to \emph{The Computer Science Conference Ranking Website}
(\url{http://www.cs-conference-ranking.org/home.html}). The
\emph{acceptance rate} of this conference is usually around
\emph{20\%}.
