%The development of a data warehouse requires an in-depth analysis of
%data sources. In the previous chapter, it is assumed that
%documentation of the data sources is available. However, this is not
%always true, since in real scenarios data sources are, in reality,
%legacy systems and their manual analysis may be extremely difficult.
%In order to overcome these problems, this chapter considers the
%development of a data warehouse as a modernization scenario which
%addresses the analysis of the available data sources, thus
%discovering multidimensional structures with which to either derive
%a data-driven conceptual multidimensional model or to reconcile a
%requirement-driven conceptual multidimensional model with data
%sources. The content of this chapter corresponds with the part of
%the approach shaded in the figure below.

%The content of this chapter was published in the \emph{International
%Conference on Conceptual Modeling (ER)}. This is one of the  most
%important conferences in data and process modeling, database
%technology, and database applications. This conference is a wide
%forum for researchers and industrial experts interested in all
%aspects of database and information systems design and usage. Topics
%of interest include data warehousing and business intelligence.
%\emph{ER} is a top-ranking conference, since it has an
%\emph{Estimated Impact of Conference (EIC)} value of \emph{0.91}
%according to \emph{The Computer Science Conference Ranking Website}
%(\url{http://www.cs-conference-ranking.org/home.html}). The
%\emph{acceptance rate} of this conference is usually around
\emph{20\%}.
